The source code in this repository requires Python 3.7 and installation of the [typing_extensions](https://github.com/python/typing/tree/master/typing_extensions) package. Due to its extensive use of Python 3.7 features (data classes, advanced type hints, etc.), most of the source code will not work with earlier versions of Python.
